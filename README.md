# nasa_r2_simulator

This repository was imported from [NASA's repository on bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/nasa_ros_pkg/deprecated_nasa_r2_simulator.git).

I've ported it to ROS Melodic.  There were a number of changes in Gazebo which required fixing.  A lot of them were related to replacing
the Gazebo math library with [Ignition Robotics' math library](https://ignitionrobotics.org/api/math/4.0/annotated.html).
